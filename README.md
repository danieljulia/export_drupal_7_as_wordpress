# export_drupal_7_as_wordpress
A simple script to export from drupal 7 to standard Wordpress


- Create a page in Drupal 7
- Copy template in theme and change xxx in the name with the id of the node
- Change options in the script (language, content type, filters, etc)
- The script creates an xml file that can be used in Wordpress to import the contents and images, in several languages if using the plugin Polylang

Feel free to modify, fork or clarify the code (i recognize it's a mess now, but it's only a quick patch to export contents that i needed once)
